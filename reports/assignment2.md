#### Question 1

- I think you didn't check the link I mentioned in the instruction -> [link](https://realpython.com/python-strings/#string-operators). I wanted more conventional operations that could be performed on strings, but I will accept the [f-Strings](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#f-strings-a-new-and-improved-way-to-format-strings-in-python) function. However, since you used it twice, you get only one point. ðŸ¤“
- You get one bonus point for creativity and using control flow methods we haven't learned.

#### Question 2

This is perfect.

#### Question 3

- There was no `less than(<)` in all the expressions given.
- `was_hit` is also a variable of type Boolean.
- You wrote `equals to` twice, the first is an **assignment operator** _(I know, I didn't mention it in class)_
